## This BAT virus is divided into the first and second editions:
* The first edition will change Administrator to cao (Chinese swear word) fuck**
* **The second version is the "definite version", after pressing Y to continue, your C drive will be formatted**
# How to avoid being attacked by the virus?
1. Don't browse irregular websites
2. Don't click on messy bullet boxes
3. **Do not open other people's files at will (especially VBS/BAT)**
4. Antivirus once a week

**For the safety of the physical machine, do not open files in non-virtual environments**
If you test in a virtual environment, you only need to change txt to bat to run
